## Project Overview

In this module, we explored Tableau, a data analysis and visualization tool that is nearly ubiquitous in today's professional world. Tableau is so popular because it allows data visualization to create assets that are visually appealing and easy for a non-technical audience to understand our presentation. Tableu helps us tell a clear story that can be easily shared with others.
